  THE CSIRO has become part of the SAHMRI community , joining together as part of the Nutrition and Metabolism Theme , to understand the connection between depression and successful weight management , unravelling the complexities in the way different individuals sense nutrients ( like glucose ) and how this effects how the body deals with it . Research is also helping to understand the mechanisms behind metabolic disease like type-2 diabetes and the role diet and nutrition plays . The work so far involves several significant dietary studies . These include investigating the effects of vitamin D on cognition , examining low carbohydrate diet and lifestyle studies for improved management of type-2 diabetes , nutritional benefits of dairy , understanding glycaemic response to cereals and breads , and delving deeper into understanding how some fats are impacting vascular health . This has culminated in the CSIRO having almost 3000 visits from our volunteers and study participants . Being located in the state of the art facility has enabled the CSIRO to easily undertake studies of this size and scope . They also launched the CSIRO Diet Score as part of their TWD Online partnership with SP Health and GI Foundation , to get a better understanding what Australians are eating and how to transform 10 years of research into a web - based platform , Australia - wide program for dietary based healthy eating plans . Examples of interaction with SAHMRI partners include : Mind and Brain - depression and obesity , studying rats to investigate dynamic changes in brain signalling ; Heart Health - unravel links between nutrition , diet and CVD risk ; Aboriginal Health - Diabetes project ; Infection and Immunity - microbiome during weight loss ; Nutrition and Metabolism - investigating mechanisms of glucose sensing and signalling in healthy fats . The CSIRO is developing foods , supplements and diets that improve the physical and cognitive health of nutrition - ally vulnerable older people . The organisation also is translating the benefits of scientifically substantiated research into food labelling messages/ front of pack health claims , is changing diet and best clinical practice guidelines , and is developing community resources including nutrition fact sheets and books . </div>
